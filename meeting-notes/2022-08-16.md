- how are the gc assembly snippets generated 
  - does it merge allocations 
- try allocating in a separate heap and link with custom routines 
  - generate `malloc` calls 
  - ocaml calling convention 
    - which registers are preserved 
- Change header repr to match Koka's repr 
  - Edits to Obj, runtime/caml/mlvalues.h 
    - Tag 8 bit 
    - Reserved 8 bits (stackless freeing) 
    - Size 16 bit 
      - Edge case: large arrays 
    - Ref count 32 bit 
  - What is the best layout? 
- Lambda form 
  - is it possible to see what "type" of value is being stored 
    - Specialize drops and dups 
    - we can do it dynamically but it will be less efficient
