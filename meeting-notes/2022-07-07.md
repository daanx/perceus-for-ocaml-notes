- OCaml Runtime system 
  - Be an expert at that 
- Check out Koka 
  - refcount.c, kk_lib.h 
- just enough information to figure out which is stack/heap allocated 
  - figure out bump allocation optimization is performed 
  - disable all things it knows about the gc 
  - where to save the ref counts? directly in the object header? 
- Core data type that OCaml uses for expressions 
  - How much type info is there? 
  - Am I able to identify things that should be dupped or dropped? 
- Initial goal: Handle simple list programs (map, filter)
