- Is it true that all registers are callee-saved? 
- Dup/Drop 
  - Add new instruction and emit custom assembly? 
  - Special CMM instruction -- but how can it reserve a register ?   (or we could use one of those globally reserved ones) 
  - Expand out dup/drop in CMM instructions so it is automatic (and hope the register allocator does a good job) 
- Write an OCaml program, manually add dup, drop 
- Q: OCaml assumes functions preserve nothing 

``` 
drop: clobbers rax, r10, r11 
%rax = p->refcount       // check first if it is a value? 
if (%rax <= 0)  
  %rax = p 
  emit_call checked_drop 
else 
  p->refcount = %rax - 1  

checked_drop: 
  if %rax < 0 then atomic decrement 
  else fast_free 

fast_free: 
  special assembly not using any registers except r15 (heap) + r10/r11 and rax? 

IAlloc: goes to fast_malloc 
emit_call fast_malloc 

fast_malloc: 
  special assembly not using any registers except r15 (heap) + r10/r11 and rax? 

dup: 
  %rax = p->refcount  
  if (%rx < 0)  
    %rax = p 
    emit_call checked_dup 
  else 
    p->refcount = %rax + 1   

``` 

 

Next steps: 
- Implement malloc, free, dup, drop 
- Manually add dups/drops 
- Then try to optimize 
- Why call gc sites? 
- Getting something working, to make sure there are no major obstacles
